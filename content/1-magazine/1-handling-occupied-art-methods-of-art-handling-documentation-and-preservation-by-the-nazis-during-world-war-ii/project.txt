Looting art is one of the most hidden and underestimated objectives of war. Behind conquering campaigns lurk the stories of deprived cultural heritage and devastation of the enemy’s cultural identity. Looting art in wartime or political disorder – from either hostile or domestic territories – has happened across the eras and results primarily from the violent occupation and destruction of political structures. Looting the enemy’s cultural valuables is a phenomenon undoubtedly entangled with the occupiers’ objectives of war. It was Adolf Hitler who intentionally copied the large systematic looting practices of Napoleon Bonaparte. During the Second World War, the Nazi ideologies fully emerged with their art plunder policy. Their looting practices grew into a wide-scale operation throughout all occupied countries. The seizure first concentrated on Jewish property as an element of the propaganda campaigns against the Jews, but quickly expanded to respond to the personal desires of Nazi officers.

The seizure of art couldn’t been accomplished without the support of antiquaries and art handlers who contributed in the expropriation, trafficking and re-sale of jewish collections and works of art identified by the Nazis as “degenerate” [1. Degenerate art. (n.d.). Retrieved January 4, 2015, from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_art]. Adolph Weinmüller, who operated as an art dealer in Munich from 1921, joined the NSAPD (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei) in 1931. During the flight of prominent Jewish art dealers, who were forced to sell their collections and close down their auction houses, Weinmüller started his Münchener Kunstversteigerungshaus *Adolf Weinmüller* [2.

Retrieved January 4, 2015, from http://lootedart.com/web_images/pdf2014/User Guide - Annotated Adolf Weinmüller Auction Catalogues (Munich and Vienna).pdf] in 1936. Supported by the Nazi party and the pretext of „Aryanization” [4. Aryanization consisted of the transfer of Jewish-owned businesses to German ownership throughout Germany and German-occupied countries before and during the Second World War. See: Aryanization. (n.d.). Retrieved January 4, 2015, from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryanization], Weinmüller arrogated two Jewish auction houses. That of Hugo Helbing in Munich in 1936 and Samuel Kende in Vienna in 1938 [5.  The Art Galleries and Auction Houses of Adolf Weinmüller in Munich and Vienna 1936-1945. (n.d.). Retrieved January 4, 2015, from http://www.lootedart.com/OFDGS2908731]. Furthermore, Weinmüller became president of the Federal association of art dealers and antiques, which gave him the possibility to eliminate his Jewish rivals by refusing the necessary licence to organize art auctions [3. Chemla, V. (2014, December 17). « Main basse sur l’art. La méthode nazie » d’Oliver Halmburger et de Thomas Staehler. Retrieved January 4, 2015, from http://www.veroniquechemla.info/2014/12/main-basse- sur-lart-la-methode-nazie.html]. He was well familiar with the content and whereabouts of pertinent jewish art collections. Therefore Weinmüller could easily point the Gestapo – one of his main art suppliers – the works of art he was specifically interested in and buy them against low prices.

Lack of evidence kept Weinmüllers’ auction practices hidden until March 2013, when 93 original catalogues were discovered in a steel cabinet in a technical room of the Neumeister auction house. Together they document 33 auctions that took place in Munich between 1936 and 1943, and at least 11 of the 18 auctions that took place in Vienna between 1938 and 1944. The documents unveil a total of 33.000 transactions of which names of consignors, purchase and hammer prices, as well as family names of the sellers and buyers are noted [6. Rudolf and Christa Neumeister bought the Münchener Kunstversteigerungshaus Adolf Weinmüller in April 1958 after the death of Adolf Weinmüller. Now directed by Katrin Stoll, the Neumeister auction house is the first German company, in collaboration with the Zentralinstitut für Kunstgeschichte (Central Institute for Art History) and with funding from the Arbeitsstelle für Provenienzforschung (Bureau for Provenance Research), to initiate a research project that investigates the history of its predecessor; the Weinmüller auction houses in Munich and Vienna.

Retrieved January 4, 2015, from http://lootedart.com/web_images/pdf2014/User Guide - Annotated Adolf Weinmüller Auction Catalogues (Munich and Vienna).pdf] . The catalogues unveil several Nazi leaders – like Hermann Göring and Martin Bormann – that visited Weinmüllers’ auction house frequently [7. Chemla, V. (2014, December 17). « Main basse sur l’art. La méthode nazie » d’Oliver Halmburger et de Thomas Staehler. Retrieved January 4, 2015, from http://www.veroniquechemla.info/2014/12/main-basse- sur-lart-la-methode-nazie.html].

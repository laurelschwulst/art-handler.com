Title: Tuesday

Back in April, when Christie’s released a Youtube promo for their self proclaimed “gritty and underbelly-esque” auction, If I live I’ll see you Tuesday, it provided, if nothing else, an opportunity for art writers across the internet to brandish some very entertaining snarkiness. Featuring pro skateboarder Chris Martin scooting through Christies’ warehouse to a soundtrack of Awolnation’s pop hit Sail, the video was summarily dismissed as part of a ‘bullshit ploy’ (Jerry Saltz, Vulture), ‘lame’ (Christopher Knight, LA Times), and ‘ridiculous’ (Michael Miller, New York Observer). The quick write off is understandable. But as difficult as it may be to sit through more than a few seconds of the production—the first hit of Sail’s electro-fuzzy bass synced to drop with a slo-mo shot of Warhol’s Electric Chair is a natural exit point—the awkward details crammed into three and a half minutes do constitute a fairly significant contribution to a wider conversation about the social configurations currently propping up the art world. It’s a conversation that Christies probably has very little interest in having, from their comfortable position in the stats quo.

Given that this video is evidently meant to represent the auction house at its coolest, its most street-savvy, it’s hard to know where to start with what they’ve actually put together. It falls somewhere between a promotional film trailer and a music video, with some pallid undertones of a skate video. There is a basic duality to the structure of the first two genres, at least: the stars and the extras; the lead singers and their back up dancers. In Christies’ version of this break down, anyone who isn’t white is wearing a service uniform of one kind or another (the handlers, security, mail clerk). A realm in which ‘professionals’ are all white is, thus, part of the coolness that is Christies. And the people in the service uniforms, regardless of skin color, are more ‘service’ than ‘people’. While it’s definitely nice to see some institutional acknowledgement that art handlers exist—and this could have been a step in a positive direction if they had been presented with any degree of depth—here they are essentially expressionless functionaries who are at times just standing beside the artworks with a blankness that goes well beyond blasé. They are little more than an extension of the gilded socio-economic framing apparatus that declares, “This is a very important Thing”, i.e. “This is a great investment, guys.” The handlers have Heidegger-ian levels of absorption in their tasks, such that they don’t even seem to notice there’s a guy skating through their workplace. This is a marked contrast to the white and white collar staff (sales assistants, receptionists, specialists) who not only notice but are unabashedly crushing on the sexy skateboarder, which, as inane as it is, at least expresses some emotional range, as well as a basic awareness of their environment. (Martin high five-ing the mail clerk is the one exception to this rule.)

When it comes to the gritty subcultural elements Christies has attempted to co-opt, Miller ridiculed in the Observer that it’s, “As if they’re marketing to a bunch of punk rockers who like skateboarding but, you know, have an extra $10 million just on standby to spend on a Warhol.” So… he owes punk rockers everywhere an apology for suggesting that they could be lured with Awolnation. As far as the skateboarding itself, it’s at best a watered-down parody of skate videos. You’d have to have basically zero exposure to the sport not to find a kickflip, a couple of ollies, a tiny grind, a teeny wall ride, and a teeny-tiny boardslide into a soft bail…pretty boring. Despite the implied edginess of letting a skateboarder near the expensive art, whenever Martin’s board touches anything but the ground there is, in fact, no art in sight. The grind and wall ride happen in some nondescript dark service corridor; otherwise he’s just cruising by. Sure, he’s very in control, but not letting him push things further is a waste of his talent and as such disregards the skill, art, and athleticism of skateboarding in manner similar to how the expertise and strength required to navigate massive, fragile, and/or otherwise unwieldy pieces of famous art around the world is rendered here as a naturalized matter of course—something to be taken for granted. It’s also worth noting that despite the multiracial makeup of the behind-the-scenes workers shown here, skateboarding and punk are traditionally white subcultures.

And let’s talk about Currin’s Reunion for a minute: a close-up of a woman with her chest being orgasmically massaged. It’s par-for-the-course Currin, not a big deal in and of itself, but its inclusion in the video does raise at least one question. Namely, why, for your auction promo video, do you have your pretty, young Post-War and Contemporary Art Specialist randomly standing around in the warehouse right beside this painting, which is hanging with the antique mirrors, which is probably not where it’s usually kept but, which, it turns out, allows you to have the scene reflected in a convex surface like some soft-porn threesome version of the Arnolfini Wedding? It’s a cheap, quick (almost subliminally fast) little attempt to sex-up the sale; in an industry in which getting hired for something as basic as invigilating is problematically dependent on girls’ attractiveness it seems a particularly tasteless decision. Like, you don’t have to be naked to work in a gallery, but we should be able to tell that if you happened to be naked, you’d be hot. When it comes to being included in this major auction, though, the number of works by female artists shown in this video (two: Cady Noland’s Percussions and Cartridge Revolvers and Cindy Sherman’s Untiled #122) is matched by the number of scantily or un-clad ladies depicted in the featured art (Currin’s Reunion, and Prince’s Untitled (Girlfriend). This suggests that naked is still the best bet. Two, incidentally, is also the number of black artists featured in the promo. Out of 22 total featured works. Prince’s works, for the record, appear five times. It’s baffling that Christies couldn’t even fake it better, or wouldn’t bother to try. 

While the auction house has been using YouTube for the past six years, mostly for posting results and staid, authoritative collection highlights, the populist veneer of this video is a significant departure from the traditional hype machine of a high-end sale—a core component of which is a lux catalog with circulation restricted to a preferred demographic. In his article for the LA times, titled, ‘An auction house does clumsy art-shtick’, Christopher Knight helpfully describes the four-pound volume for If I live…: 

The catalog, which features an expensive die-cut slipcover, is jampacked with photos, lots of them in costly color. Many are celebrity lifestyle shots, with artists at work or deep in contemplation; they're like spreads in W or Vogue.

Knight goes on to observe:

There is one catch, however. Books are so over. They might be mildly useful to fabricate a veneer of history when idly flipping through a picture-book; but, what about the new and the now? What about digital?

Well, the medium is not automatically the message to the extent it seems Christies hoped it would be. While the pressure of the digital now has obviously become too great to ignore, just because you’re using a form of mass media it doesn’t mean you’re automatically speaking in the vernacular of the masses. The fumbling insertion of this fundamentally 1%-ish version of the art world into Youtube just serves to amplify its vulgarity as well as its inexcusable—and, here, particularly hypocritical—neglect of broader social issues. Presenting the racist, sexist structures of their business as ‘cool and gritty’ prompts the question, ‘What does Gouzer actually mean by these terms?’ By ‘underbelly-esque’ is he referring to work made from a position of power that is gratuitously ‘edgy/provocative/risqué’? Or, to work by artists like David Hammons, with his extensive involvement in civil rights and black power movements, whose art is included in the sale but was evidently not deemed exciting enough for this highlights reel? The idea that could be encompassed by a singular vision of ‘darkness’ seems untenable.

 An artwork is a focal point within a network of social relations; it is becoming increasingly difficult for the art industry to ignore the fact that this network includes the diverse segment of people who safe-guard its physical wellbeing and build the environments that expand its social potential and dollar value. Christies does employ unionized workers but in attempting to capitalize on whatever cred this slowly rising consciousness might be able to bring to a promotion campaign they should have been able to present these workers as something more than props. That said, in the art world, the feeling of being seen as an easily exchangeable background prop might be familiar to many unpaid interns and short-term contract art workers who have to worry that a sudden flu might mean they can’t pay rent. In riffing on the film industry the way Christies has, with a viral trailer for their sale, they also happen to be referencing a creative field in which behind the scenes workers have widely organized to protect their livelihood. Youtube also currently hosts Robert Florey and Slavko Vorkapich’s 1928 experimental film The Life and Death of 9413: a Hollywood Extra, in which a keen, young would-be star arrives in Hollywood, only to have a de-humanizing number stamped on his head, and to eventually die from poverty induced by the inconsistency of trying to work in the industry as an extra. While you can’t make a flat comparison between an indie film and a promotional video, it is nonetheless remarkable how much more socially relevant an intentionally hyperbolic production that’s coming up on one hundred years old feels, than Christies efforts do.

Considering their ongoing rivalry with Sotheby’s, Christie’ faux-risque ‘it’s all cool in our warehouse’ angle seems a pointed but possibly dissembling contrast to Sotheby’s locked out workers protesting the 2012 Whitney Biennial. It feels like it could be a pre-emptive version of Frieze Art Fair’s “No labour dispute here, folks” response to protests about their decision to import (from Wisconsin) entirely non-unionized labor. It’s consistent with how a Christies official described Wade Guyton multiplying his own print to protest skyrocketing auction prices, as ‘fun’, while the establishment regrammed his pics. This is not to comment on the specificities of current labor conditions at Christies, or to suggest they are intentionally obfuscating any particular events or interactions. Rather, their video exemplifies a tendency to gloss over serious structural flaws on the part of those who are best able to capitalize on the current system, as broken as it is. This is perhaps most succinctly expressed by how the press release for If I Live I’ll See You Tuesday eagerly declares Warhol’s Electric Chair, a ‘cornerstone’ of the gritty auction—enthusing about its ‘punchy’ yellows and ability to transform a room, waxing lyrical about mortality and shadows—while declining to reference the fact that we live in a society that produces statistics like, “Jurors in Washington state are three times more likely to recommend a death sentence for a black defendant than for a white defendant in a similar case. (Prof. K. Beckett, Univ. of Washington, 2014)”, and, “In Louisiana, the odds of a death sentence were 97% higher for those whose victim was white than for those whose victim was black. (Pierce & Radelet, Louisiana Law Review, 2011)”. The symbols Christies uses to get adrenaline and cash flowing are severed from all but the most shallow levels of social and political relevance. To return to Miller’s statement about the absurdity of marketing to hypothetically impossible punk rockers with trust funds, while his point may be taken, it is difficult to imagine that this video was ever intended for anyone but people who want to buy cool without being at all involved with—or particularly aware off— anything too ‘underbelly-esque’. In that sense, it was a perfect video for their target demographic.

##Mission

ART HANDLER is a new print and online publication, which deals with the social and cultural impacts of behind-the-scenes labor in the art world. The magazine reconsiders the worker in museums, galleries, studios, and other sites, both practically and theoretically. By focusing on this field, we wish to offer our readers new insight on other interactions within the art world that are normally hidden. The call for new reflections on the mechanisms of the art industry can hopefully foster greater understandings on art and its practice for everyone involved. ART HANDLER is inclusive and revelatory.

Through a combination of photography, editorials, research, and journalism, the magazine provides a clear platform for an essential and working community. Engaging audiences of all stations, ART HANDLER unpacks a more complete view of a major cultural industry that is useful to critics, artists, curators, and more.

======================
This is a website for a magazine about art handling.

### Colophon

Design and main programming is by [Beautiful Company](http://beautiful-company.com).

Special thanks to [Dexter Edwards](https://github.com/dexteredwards) and [Matt Lenz](https://github.com/mattlenz) for their programming contributions.

The site is built on [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com/).

### Installation

After downloading, add a new folder “content” to the root directory. Inside “content”, add two new empty folders: “error” and “home”.

I like to use [MAMP](http://mamp.info) to locally run PHP. If you use MAMP, place folder in MAMP’s “htldocs” folder. Navigate to /panel and you should be on your way.
